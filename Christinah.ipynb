        "To transition from 1NF to 2NF, we need all columns in all tables to not have a partial dependancy on the PK of the table. This means that any tables which have a composite key e.g. `PRIMARY KEY(\"Barcode\",\"NavigationPath\",\"ItemDescription\")` cannot have columns in the table which are dependant on only `Barcode`, `NavigationPath`, or `ItemDescription`.\n",
        "\n",
        "In moving to 2NF we will seperate out each of these as a primary key (for their own respective tables), and any columns dependant on one of these columns but not the others, will go into that table. The only columns remaining in the tables will be fully functionally dependant on the primary key of the table. For example,\n",

        "<br>$\\bullet$ This can be achieved in 2 ways: create a unique identifier per row (so that there is a simple primary key), or break the table up into only the columns which are fully dependant on the composite key.\n",
        "<br>$\\bullet$ We are going to opt for the easier solution, and create a unique simple primary key on the `Transactions_1NF`. We can create a unique primary key by concatenating `CartID||barcode`\n",
        "<br>$\\bullet$ NB - this approach does make it more challenging to get into 3NF! Which would be a good argument to opt for the latter approach."

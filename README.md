#3 Bhejane Trading Project

This project was created as part of the Explore A.I Academy bootcamp. 

This project is a database normalization exercise. It uses the SQL language and an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to transform a denormalized database into third normal form (3NF) using SQLite.

The tools used in this project are:

SQLite: A lightweight database management system

The steps involved in this project are:

Import the denormalized database into SQLite.
Create an ERD of the denormalized database.
Identify the functional dependencies between the attributes in the denormalized tables.
Remove any transitive dependencies from the tables.
Create new tables if necessary to break any transitive dependencies.
Ensure that all tables are in third normal form.
The MCQ test contains questions about  client's use-cases for the database.
